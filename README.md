What's in your cart?

3 million customer orders from the online food shopping company Instacart spanned across multiple CSV files

* MVP: 
    - Can I predict what will be in the customer's next order?
    - Can I predict top day & time of orders?
* MVP +:
    - Explore items in cart, what is most popular?
    - Do "groups" (those who mainly by produce, process, or a mix) have different purchasing patterns?
    - Can I predict churn rate if I say customers "have churned" after not order  within 30 days?
