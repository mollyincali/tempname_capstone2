## Principal Components
- I organized my data frame to be users and the number of items for each aisle they purchaed per order. I wanted to explore PCA to see how many features I can reduce my matrix down to.
- Realizing that I needed to have 117 feautres to account for 90% variance in my model tells me that my features are already orthogonal (or pretty close)
